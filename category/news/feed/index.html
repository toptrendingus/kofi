<p><strong>Mohammedan turned around a little late after handling the shock of falling back in the beginning. The champions started their journey to the Federation Cup after defeating Chittagong Abahani.</strong></p>



<p>Mohammedan won 2-1 at Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni Stadium in Gopalganj. Mozaffar Mozaffarov made the fate of the match after Zafar Iqbal equalized the team behind Aziz Abolaji Abu.</p>



<p>On this day, the beginning of Mohammedan was simple. The team in the rhythm of the Premier League scored in the 13th minute from a set piece. Sujan Biswas beat Sujan Biswas with an unguarded Nigerian forward, Abu Ghraman, who received the ball from a free kick at the far post.</p>



<p>After falling behind, Mohammedans regained momentum in the game. In first-half stoppage time, Zafar raced over to find the back of the net after Mozaffarov&#8217;s curling free kick went over the wall and hit the post. The white and black jersey holders go to the break with the relief of equality.</p>



<p>In the second half, Mohammedan continued to increase the intensity of the attack. The 11-time champions, second highest in the competition, got the desired goal in the 55th minute.</p>



<p>A defender of Chittagong Abahani could not clear the corner head. The ball went to the far post, from where Emmanuel Sund&#8217;s head keeper Ashraful Islam Rana was blocked by Uzbekistan midfielder Mozaffarov on the return side volley.</p>



<p>After going forward, Mohammedan concentrated on the game keeping the defense frozen. In the 63rd minute, Shahriar Emon could not take a proper header. The gap did not increase as the ball that went up quite high easily deposited in Rana&#8217;s gloves.</p>



<p>At the end, Chittagong Abahani tried desperately to return to the match; But Mohammedan&#8217;s solid defense kept their efforts from outside the box.</p>



<p>In the 85th minute, Rayhan Hasan&#8217;s curling free kick attempted to find the net at the far post. Goalkeeper Sujan kept Mohammedan on the way to victory with a lot of jumps and fists.</p>

<p><strong>Emma Radukanu returned to the court a couple of months ago after being out for a long time due to injury. Now he entered the Grand Slam fight. It&#8217;s great for the British star to be back on the big stage. Shelby swept Rogers in straight sets in the second round of the Australian Open.</strong></p>



<p>The 21-year-old player has not played in any major tournament since the last edition of this competition in Melbourne. He was off the court for about eight months after undergoing wrist and ankle surgery.</p>



<p>On the day he returned to the majors with the first Grand Slam of the year, he defeated Rogers of the United States 6-3, 6-2 on Monday.</p>



<p>At the age of 18, Radukanu rose to the limelight of the tennis world by winning the 2021 US Open. In that incredible campaign, he became the first player in Grand Slam history to win the title after qualifying. An unknown name became a world star.</p>



<p>Later, though, Radukanu could not maintain that early lead. He contracted the coronavirus, followed by injuries, and luck was not on his side. His position is now 296 in the ranking.</p>



<p>However, there is a glimpse of that old rhythm returning to his game. He played excellent serves and groundstrokes on his way to crushing Rogers. Many are looking at how far Radukanu can pull the form.</p>



<p>Radukanu will face China&#8217;s Wang Yafan next Thursday in the fight to advance to the third round.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://media.assettype.com/bdnews24%2F2024-01%2F27b8474d-2335-4ba3-a8fa-b04367ca8759%2Fnaomi_osaka_160124_02.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;format=webp&amp;w=1536" alt="গ্র্যান্ড স্ল্যামে ফেরাটা জয়ে রাঙালেন রাডুকানু"/></figure>



<p>After a long break, the return of another female star Naomi Osaka to the Grand Slam was not pleasant. After the maternity break, she returned to tennis with the Brisbane Open a few days ago. But lost in the second round.</p>



<p>This Japanese lost in the first round in the Australian Open. France&#8217;s Caholin Garcia defeated the two-time champion 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) in this Melbourne competition.</p>



<p>However, the 26-year-old star is not disappointed with this loss. The four-time Grand Slam winner in women&#8217;s singles wants to spend busy time on the front court to regain herself. That&#8217;s how you plan.</p>

<p><strong>FIFA not only honored Marta Vieira de Silva for her long career, but also gave great recognition. The name of the Brazilian great has announced a new award of women&#8217;s football &#8211; &#8216;Marta Award.&#8217;</strong></p>



<p>Marta holds the record for the highest number of goals scored by men and women in the World Cup with 17 goals. He is also the first player to score five consecutive goals on the world stage of football. FIFA honored him with a special trophy at The Best FIFA Football Awards in London on Monday night for his contribution to football for more than 20 years. It was there that the award of the best goal of the year was announced under the name of the women&#8217;s football superstar.</p>



<p>Marta also once held the record for both men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s FIFA Footballer of the Year awards, winning six times. Later he was overtaken by Argentine superstar Lionel Messi. This is the eighth time he has won this year.</p>



<p>FIFA has an award for the best goal of the year. Since 2009, they have been giving the Puskas Award for spectacular goals. The first was won by Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. For a stunning goal from 40 yards for Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-final against Porto.</p>



<p>Real Madrid and Hungary legend Puskas could not see the award launched in his name. He died in 2006, the award was launched in October 2009.</p>



<p>Both male and female footballers were considered for the award, but for the first two years only men were in the top ten. USA&#8217;s Heather O&#8217;Reilly made it to the list of top 10 goals for her great goal against Colombia in 2011 World Cup.</p>



<p>In 2014, a woman made the top three for the first time. Ireland&#8217;s Stephanie Rush finished second behind Colombia&#8217;s James Rodriguez. Since then, only two others &#8211; Daniuska Rodríguez (2016) and Denia Castianos (2017) from Venezuela &#8211; have made the top three.</p>



<p>The Puskas Award is determined by a vote of football fans registered on the FIFA website. There, male footballers who are far ahead in terms of fan base have an added advantage.</p>



<p>Alecia Russo was considered a strong contender last year to become the first female footballer to win the award. The English forward scored a stunning back-heel goal against Sweden at the Women&#8217;s Euros. But he could not come in the top three.</p>



<p>If the Puskas Award had been launched in the previous year instead of 2009, Marta might have been considered. He scored a brilliant goal in the 4-0 World Cup semi-final win over the USA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marta is very happy to receive the award in her own name.</p>



<p>“Of course, it (becoming a record six FIFA Man of the Year) gives me great joy. But this recognition elevates not only Marta, but all of us—Brazil as a nation.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I will not play again in the World Cup. I am very happy with the way women&#8217;s football has developed in Brazil and in the world. There are incredibly talented girls who have great futures ahead of them. It&#8217;s just the beginning for them, but the end for me.&#8221;</p>
