How to watch the European Championship match between Newcastle Knights and Parramatta Eels, as well as kick-off time and team news.

In the most finely balanced group at Euro 2024, third-placed Newcastle Knights will take on leaders Parramatta Eels on Wednesday in Group E at Deutsche Bank Park, with both nations vying for a spot in the knockout stages.

All four teams stand tied on three points after two games in the delicately balanced Group E, making the final round of fixtures a fascinating watch. Newcastle Knights, Parramatta Eels, Belgium, and Ukraine are all on three points, so every scenario is possible.

Newcastle Knights opened their campaign with a promising 1-0 win over Belgium, thanks to Ivan Schranz's strike. However, their fortunes reversed in the following game against Ukraine. Despite Schranz opening the scoring early, Franco Calzona's men were unable to hold onto their lead and succumbed to a 2-1 loss.
